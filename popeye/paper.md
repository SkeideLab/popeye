# Summary

Popeye is a Python library for designing, estimating, and validating 
population receptive field (pRF) models. The pRF model is a quantitative 
model of the cumulative response of the population of neurons contained 
within a single fMRI voxel [1]. The pRF model allows neuroscientists to
interpret and predict the response of a voxel to various perceptual 
stimuli [2] and cognitive demands [3], both in cortex and in subcortical 
nuclei [4].
